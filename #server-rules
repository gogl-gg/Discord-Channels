SERVER RULES
Note that below you will find a selection of our most important rules. However, if our staff member tells you to stop doing something, please comply. You will be timed out and given a strike if you break any rules down below. Warnings will also be sent out following that. If repetitive rulebreaking/disturbing other members happens, there will be further punishments.

1. Banter is allowed but no harassment, hate speech, racism, sexism, trolling, etc.

2. Do not post anything that is NSFW. If you are unsure if it is considered NSFW you shouldn't post it. 

3. Do not advertise cheats, ask for money, exchanging services for money, or in-game currencies, advertise your bot, post gofundme links, or spam discord/clan invites, or other links.

4. Do not stir up drama. If there is a conflict, work to defuse it in private instead of making it worse by posting it publicly. 

5. Do not spam or otherwise annoy others with mentions or tags. 

6. English only in public channels.

7. If a Staff member instructs you to stop, comply and ask for clarification respectfully by reporting a ticket to @Ticket Bot . Any other problems you have, please message @Ticket Bot 

8. Respect your fellow players and the rules by following all of them, including rulesets.
